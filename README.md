# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis is being performed to understand the impact each city type has to the PyBer business earnings. The analysis will be utilized to establist best next steps for improving business earnings.
## Results
### Urban City Impact
Results indicate that urban cities bring in the highest total fares, making up 62.7% of all fares across all city types. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver. I believe this is because urban cities have higher populations, accounting for more rides. Additionally, urban cities have higher population densitites, meaning that the average rider will be traveling a shorter distance than in suburban or rural cities. 
### Suburban City Impact

### Rural City Impact

## Summary
My recommendation is to hone in on urban cities as the priority population to market to. Since urban cities make up most of the profit, we want to continue to leverage this demographic. I would also recommend special efforts to market to suburban and rural populations. Since average fare per driver in both locations is significantly higher than in urban cities, it would take a smaller amount of additional rides to grow profit. Perhaps a good way to do this is to make ride sharing options more easily accessible in high traffic areas in suburban and rural cities - such as smaller airports, train stations or city centers.
