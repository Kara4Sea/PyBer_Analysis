### Urban City Impact
Results indicate that urban cities bring in the highest total fares, making up 62.7% of all fares across all city types. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver. I believe this is because urban cities have higher populations, accounting for more rides. Additionally, urban cities have higher population densitites, meaning that the average rider will be traveling a shorter distance than in suburban or rural cities. 
### Suburban City Impact

### Rural City Impact

## Summary
My recommendation is to approach each city type to grow sales differently.
* Urban - I recommend honing in on urban cities as the priority population to market to. Since urban cities make up most of the profit, we want to continue to leverage this demographic. 
* I would also recommend special efforts to market to suburban and rural populations. Since average fare per driver in both locations is significantly higher than in urban cities, it would take a smaller amount of additional rides to grow profit. Perhaps a good way to do this is to make ride sharing options more easily accessible in high traffic areas in suburban and rural cities - such as smaller airports, train stations or city centers.
*Ride average goes up in late February and early March. What is taking place during this time of year to prompt more rides than typical? Is there a way to leverage the reason for this busy time to grow sales further? Examples would be conference driving travel, weather prompting people to walk less.
