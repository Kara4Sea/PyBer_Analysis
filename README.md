### Urban City Impact
Results indicate that urban cities bring in the highest total fares, making up 62.7% of all fares across all city types. However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver. I believe this is because urban cities have higher populations, accounting for more rides. Additionally, urban cities have higher population densitites, meaning that the average rider will be traveling a shorter distance than in suburban or rural cities. 

Another note is that urban cities have the highest amount of total drivers accounting for 68.4% of drivers across all types of cities. It's possible that urban cities see more rides because more drivers are available to facilitate rides.
### Suburban City Impact
Results indicate that suburban cities bring in the middle set total fares. This trend follows suit across the board, with suburban cities coming in middle place for Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per ride, and Average Fare per driver. I believe this is because suburban cities have middle-set level of population compared to urban and rural. Additionally, suburban cities have higher population densitites than rural cities but lower population densities than urban cities, meaning that the average rider will be traveling a shorter distance than in rural cities, but a longer distance than urban cities. 

### Rural City Impact
Results indicate that rural cities bring in the least amount of total fares. Rural cities coming in last place for Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares. However, Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per ride and Average Fare per driver. I believe this is because rural cities have the smallest population compared to urban and suburban. Additionally, rural cities have lowest population densitites, meaning that the average rider will be traveling a longer distance.

### Fare by City Type over Time
Throughout January to April 2019, each city type follows somewhat similar trends in total fare. Urban cities experience the highest fare total in late February / early March. And the least in early January. Suburban cities experience the higher fare total in late February, and the lowest in early January. Rural citieis experience highest total fares in early April, and the lowest in mid January and mid February.

## Summary
My recommendation is to approach each city type differently to grow sales.
* Urban - I recommend honing in on urban cities as the priority population to market to. Since urban cities make up most of the profit, we want to continue to leverage this demographic. 
* I would also recommend special efforts to market to suburban and rural populations. Since average fare per driver in both locations is significantly higher than in urban cities, it would take a smaller amount of additional rides to grow profit. 
    * Perhaps a good way to do this is to make ride sharing options more easily accessible in high traffic areas in suburban and rural cities - such as small airports, train stations or city centers.
    * Incentives to increase the number of drivers in Suburban and Rural cities could assist with increasing rides.
* In each city type, it will be helpful to look at what is taking place during times of year with peak total fares of year to prompt more rides than typical. Is there a way to leverage the reason for this busy time to grow sales further? Examples would be conferences or events driving travel, holidays or inclement weather prompting people to walk less.
* It would be interesting to also pull data from the holiday months over November and December. Is it possible that urban customers are traveling to see family in rural and suburban areas? If so, could this information be utilized to market to use the ride share service during family visits to drive up total rates in suburban and rural areas?
